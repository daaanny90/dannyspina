Here we are again with the weekly retro! This time I have a justification for the pause... a newborn takes a lot of time!

### Monday

I'm still at the beginning in this new agency and starting on new projects is always a bit slow... half of the accounts are active, little knowledge of the processes... for now, I'm taking my time to get oriented. **Mood:** 🦥

### Tuesday

Another fairly slow day, I'm trying to orient myself in the codebase and I always pay close attention to my colleagues' discussions during meetings, in order to pick up information that can help me navigate the code more effectively. **Mood:** 🕵️

### Wednesday

Finally, something is moving - the accounts are active! I'm taking on my first small tasks and gaining experience in how the various components work. And of course, a few noob mistakes are to be expected. **Mood:** 😅

### Thursday

First PR is open, and a little code review is good to get to know the codebase. I'm getting familiar with the tests as well, and there are a ton of them in the frontend library we're developing - the pipeline takes 40 minutes to deploy! **Mood:** 👨‍💻

### Friday

Friday, today is one of the two free Fridays where we work on internal or personal projects. I took the opportunity to tidy up some details in my side projects and worked on the dark mode for the DresdenJs website. Astro is an interesting framework. **Mood:** 🏖️
