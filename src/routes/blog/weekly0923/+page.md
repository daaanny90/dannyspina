### Monday, Tuesday

Days off

### Wednesday

First day in the new company! I spent the day setting up my new laptop and knowing better my new collegues. A new adventure is going to begin! **Mood:** 🤩

### Thursday

Keep setting up the laptop, and I got an introduction to the little project where I can start to play a bit with the code. Is an interesting intern tool, written in Lit, that I've never used. It sounds a really interesting library, that let you work with native web components with some superpower. **Mood:** 👨‍💻

### Friday

My imposter's syndrome kicked in! I take this feeling as a sign of growth, that I made the right decision to challenge myself by taking a new position with a new company. I finally have a full-time position doing front-end development with TypeScript, and I have a lot to learn. **Mood:** 🤓
