During the pandemic, Oliviero Toscani's Instagram was buzzing with activity as he conducted numerous live sessions. Being an enthusiastic follower, I never missed a single one, and little did I know that one of those sessions would reignite my passion for photography. At that time, I had set my photography hobby aside, but the excitement of this unique contest prompted me to participate once again.

I may not have been a professional photographer anymore, but I couldn't resist the chance to showcase my creativity. The theme of the contest was "What does quarantine mean to you?" and the twist was that all entries had to be self-portraits. Inspired by the challenge, I decided to capture different expressions on my face, playing with exposure times to convey the emotions of those challenging times. Additionally, I clicked a portrait of my wife while she yawned, symbolizing the boredom of quarantine.

As I submitted my photos, doubts lingered in my mind. Oliviero Toscani was known for his exacting standards, and I wondered if my shots would meet his discerning eye. Nevertheless, I held onto a glimmer of hope, eager to see the selected photographs that would grace the front page of Repubblica.

Then, during one of his live sessions with Gad Lerner, Oliviero decided to showcase the intriguing contest entries. He playfully acknowledged that there were many mediocre submissions but also a few exceptional ones. My heart raced as he began to scroll through the pictures.

And there it was â€“ my wife's portrait, frozen in time, captivating both Oliviero Toscani and Gad Lerner. I couldn't believe my eyes! I immediately took a screenshot to cherish the unforgettable moment. Seeing two creative geniuses appreciate my photograph was a validation that reignited my passion for photography.

It's incredible how a single moment of appreciation can have such a profound impact. Every time I think back to that incredible encounter, the desire to take my camera in hand returns, pulling me back into the world of photography. The joy and recognition I experienced during that live session have become a source of inspiration, reminding me of the artistic flame that still burns within me.

Since that incredible event, life has brought changes and responsibilities, and my photography journey has taken a back seat. Yet, the memory of Oliviero Toscani and Gad Lerner admiring my photo reminds me that creativity never truly fades away. As I navigate life's twists and turns, I know that the passion for photography will always be there, waiting for the perfect moment to capture life's beautiful stories once again.
