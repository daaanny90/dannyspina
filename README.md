## üöÄ CLI for Generating Blog Posts and Books

This repository includes a simple Node.js CLI script that helps you generate blog posts and book posts for your static website. The script allows you to create a new blog post or book post, providing the necessary details like title, subtitle, category, author, Amazon link, and URL name.

### Usage

To use the CLI script for generating blog posts and books, you can run it directly using Node.js as follows:

```bash
node ./scripts/blog_cli.cjs new-post
```

To create a new blog post, use the new-post command. The script will guide you through a series of prompts to enter the necessary details for the blog post, such as the post title, subtitle, category, and URL name. After providing these details, the script will create a new blog post file under the 'src/routes/blog' directory with the specified content.

```bash
node ./scripts/blog_cli.cjs new-book
```

To create a new book post, use the new-book command. The script will prompt you to enter the necessary details for the book post, including the book title, author, Amazon link, category, and URL name. After providing these details, the script will create a new book post file under the 'src/routes/books' directory with the specified content.

Additionally, the script will create and checkout a new Git branch with the name 'blog*{postName}' for blog posts and 'book*{bookName}' for book posts, allowing you to work on the post separately.

### Zsh alias

Add this to the `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias <your-alias>='node ~/<path-to-this-repo>/scripts/blog_cli.cjs'
```

Replace `<your-alias>` with your preferred alias and `<path-to-this-repo>` with the actual path to this repository. This will allow you to use the CLI script more conveniently.

### Examples

Here's an example of how to use the CLI script to create a new blog post:

```bash
node ./scripts/blog_cli.cjs new-post
```

The script will prompt for post details, and then create the post file and branch.

Here's an example of how to use the CLI script to create a new book post:

```bash
node ./scripts/blog_cli.cjs new-book
```

The script will prompt for book details, and then create the book post file and branch.
