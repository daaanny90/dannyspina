I was talking with a friend about the good old ethical problems of the full self driving cars.

Let's pretend to have built a wonderful self driving car, and it works so well, that everywhere in the world the people are allowed to let their car driving for them. Legally are self driving car allowed.

I want to emphasize full self driving cars. What I mean are cars that can drive from the home door to work without the intervention of the driver. That actually become almost a passenger. A driver could sleep the whole trip, and it would break any law. Cars are totally allowed to self drive.

Now, imagine that one of this cars is in trouble. Happens an emergency situation where the car should choose between two choiches:

  1. sacrifice your life to save the life of another person
  **Example**: a person cross the road without looking. The speed of the car, the environment and the position of the person let the car only two choiches: turn relly hard the steering wheel left or right, saving the life of the person, but probably you will die, as the car is also going to crash against a wall **OR** will try to brake but probably the person will die.
  2. choose between two people
  **Example**: two people are crossing the roead, and the car must choose if turn right and save the person in the left, or the opposite.

I doubt that this kind of situation could really happen in the reality or if it has an extremely low possibility to happen. I think about this more like a nice exercise for our mind and heart.

Then, we talked about this choice, and I tried to explain my point of view, and there are some really good pros the self driving cars can have.

## Many fewer deaths from road accidents.
<!-- TODO: go on writing-->
The computer that drives the car is WAY more faster than you 

## Fewer traffic jam
<!-- TODO: go on writing-->

## The farmaceutical Example
<!-- TODO: go on writing, the pill save 9/10 lifes, but 1 on a million can have problems from the vaccine-->

## Kill the driver!

<!-- TODO: go on writing, come nelle medicine, dove ti scrivo che il medicinale salva le vite ma in casi rarissimi puo creare problemi seri alla persona che prende la meicina. E le persone la prendono, perche i benefici superano di gran lunga gli effetti collaterali. Con l#auto uguale, si avvisano i conducenti che quel tipo di auto ha salvato milioni di vite ogni anno, e che c#e pero una probabilita su qualche milione, che la macchina e gia addestrata in caso di incidente problematico (come quelli sopra) di salvare le vite degli altri a discapito di quella del conducente -->
