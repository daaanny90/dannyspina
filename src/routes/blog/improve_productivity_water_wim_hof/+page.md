## Cold Shower

**Taking** a **refreshing** and **invigorating** **cold shower** in the morning can be an incredibly **beneficial** way to start the day. Not only can it help to **energize** us, but it can also have a profound effect on our overall **health**. **Cold showers** can help to **improve** circulation and **decrease** inflammation, while also promoting **alertness** and **reducing** stress and anxiety levels. Furthermore, they can even aid in promoting **healthier sleep**, and can help to **increase** our productivity and give us a sense of **well-being** by providing a burst of energy and helping to **improve** our overall health. Therefore, regularly taking a cold shower can be an excellent way to start the day and provide us with the energy to tackle the tasks ahead.

**My first experience** with the **cold shower** was a shock and an epiphany at the same time. I had always considered **myself to have a strong control** of my mind, as I **meditated regularly** and read a lot of books about **self-improvement**. However, when I stepped into the **cold water**, it felt like my mind had become a wild horse and I couldn't take control of it. I tried to **focus on my breath and the sensation of the cold**, but I couldn't. After a few seconds, I got out and started **laughing uncontrollably** - I guess it was my way of dealing with the shock. I had never felt so out of control, and it made me realize that I still had much to learn about myself and that I had to **take control of this part of my mind**. This new realization gave me the motivation to **keep pushing myself**, to practice **breathing exercises and cold showers**, even when I didn't want to. The **cold shower** has become a way for me to **strengthen my willpower**, as I face each morning something that I don't particularly want to do, but have to do it. This is an exercise that can be transferred to other aspects of my life, where I tend to procrastinate. I have become more aware of my own **strength and mental power**, and I have seen the results of this practice in my everyday life.

Moreover, I felt an **incredible amount of energy** from the day I started taking cold showers. I couldn't believe I could have so much energy - my mood was really good and I had energy until the evening, where I would normally feel tired and unmotivated. I experience the same every day since I started with a cold shower and days with a bad mood happen, but they are nowhere near as bad as they were without a cold shower. It **literally changed my life**!
