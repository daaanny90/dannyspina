### Monday, Tuesday
Day off

### Wednesday
First day in the new company! I spent the day setting up my new laptop and knowing better my new collegues. A new adventure is going to begin!

### Thursday
Keep setting up the laptop, and I got an introduction to the little project where I can start to play a bit with the code. Is an interesting intern tool, written in Lit, that I've never used. It sounds a really interesting library, that let you work with native web components with some superpower.
