## Monday

Weekly is back! I’m trying to resume my old habits after my second daughter is born (some months ago 🙈). Today I spent the day to solve issues found in my PR during code review. And I love hard code reviews. Mood: 👨‍💻

## Tuesday

Today we meet our collegues live. Is nice to see each others in person, the meetings are really different when made live. We use this occasions to talk about complicated or important stuff. And we have the chance to talk about non technical stuff and know better each other. Mood: 🤝

## Wednesday

Finally my PR is ready! I work on this story since more than 5-6 weeks now, and I solved all the issues found in the code review. I must only finalize some details and then will be ready to me merged. A milestone reached! Mood: 🥳

## Thursday

Meeting day today, but I was anyway productive. Remember the ready PR? Not ready yet 😅 but it needs just some adjustments. Mood: 🛠️

## Friday

Today is the “free day” where we can work on some intern projects for the company, not only with code. I worked anyway a bit for my main project where I work for. I need to check those to do points! Mood:
