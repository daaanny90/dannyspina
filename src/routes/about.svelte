<PageTitle title="About Me" subtitle="" />
<p>
	I call myself "a digital craftsman." I am a developer, mostly web, and every day I try to build
	digital products to the best of my ability. I did not start programming as a child, but at the age
	of 25.
</p>

<p>
	I went through a 3 years training that in the end led me to become, for what it can mean, a
	"full-stack" developer.
</p>
<p>
	I am passionate about programming and the world of the Internet, open source philosophy and the
	ethical choices behind software. I work with many different technologies and never get tired of
	trying new things.

<p>Feel free to contact me.</p>
