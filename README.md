| Hosting   | Netlify, Node pinned to 20.20.0 (`.nvmrc` + `netlify.toml`)         |

No Tailwind, no CSS framework. The design system is "Sistema 2b" — a technical-sheet /
graphite look defined by the tokens file and a small set of components (`SpecTable`,
`ServiceSheet`, `RulerDivider`, `PostCard`).

## Getting started

```bash
nvm use          # 20.20.0
npm install
npm run dev      # vite dev --host
```

| Script            | What it does                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Dev server                                                  |
| `npm run build`   | `vite build` — prerenders every route to `build/`           |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the built output                                     |
| `npm run check`   | `svelte-check` against `tsconfig.json`                      |
| `npm run lint`    | `prettier --check` + `eslint` (also enforced on Netlify CI) |
| `npm run format`  | `prettier --write .`                                        |

`postbuild` runs `svelte-sitemap` against `https://dannyspina.com`, excluding `/library`,
`/meet` and `/books/**`.

## Content

Everything is markdown in the routes tree — `+page.md` inside a folder named after the slug.

**Blog post** — `src/routes/blog/<slug>/+page.md`

```yaml
---
title: NPMGuard
subtitle: A tool to identify weakness in your package.json
date: "2025-03-20"
categories:
  - "Projects"
human: 90 # optional 0–100, drives the AiIndicator badge (see /ai)
---
```

Posts can import `ImagePost`, `Gallery`, `Sidenote` and `Callout` in a `<script>` block.
Images go in `static/images/blog/<slug>/`.

**Book note** — `src/routes/books/<slug>/+page.md`

```yaml
---
title: Dopamine Nation
author: Anna Lembke
amazonLink:
category: Personal Growth
description: >-
  Used as the SEO description.
---
```

The whole `/books` section is `noindex` and excluded from the sitemap.

**Podcast episodes** are not files — `/api/episodes.json` parses the Anchor.fm RSS at build
time, so new episodes only appear after a rebuild. `.github/workflows/rss-check.yml` runs
weekly (Sunday 00:00 UTC), diffs the feed against `.last-episode`, and pings the
`NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK` secret when something changed.

### Authoring CLI

```bash
node ./scripts/blog_cli.cjs new-post   # scaffolds src/routes/blog/<slug>/+page.md
                                       # + static/images/blog/<slug>/, branches to blog_<slug>
node ./scripts/blog_cli.cjs new-book   # scaffolds src/routes/books/<slug>/+page.md
```

Handy alias for `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
alias blog='node ~/<path-to-this-repo>/scripts/blog_cli.cjs'
```

## SEO

`src/lib/components/Seo.svelte` is the single entry point, used by every page: title, meta
description, canonical (skipped when `noindex`), Open Graph, Twitter cards and JSON-LD.
It builds `BlogPosting` automatically for `type="article"` and merges any `schema` prop —
that's how the homepage gets `Person`/`WebSite` and the service pages get `Service`.
Defaults live in `src/lib/siteConfig.ts`.

## Deployment

Netlify builds from the default branch. `netlify.toml` pins Node and holds the 301
redirects: two shortlinks (`/library` → Drive folder, `/meet` → Jit.si room), the removed
`/archive/*` weeklies → `/blog`, and three renamed post slugs. Keep a redirect here
whenever a slug changes. The contact form uses Netlify Forms with a honeypot and redirects
to `/contacts/thanks`.

## Notion widgets

`/notion/weekinfo` renders progress bars for the current day, week, quarter and year —
meant to be embedded in Notion. It's excluded from the site chrome and from `robots.txt`.

## Notes and rough edges

- **Markdown only lives under `blog/` or `books/`.** mdsvex has no fallback layout, so a
  `.md` file anywhere else will fail to resolve one. Add a named layout in
  `svelte.config.js` first if you need a third content type.
- **The site is dark only.** There is no theme toggle; `app.html` reads `localStorage.theme`
  and falls back to dark. `tokens.css` still carries a light palette if it's ever wired up.
- `rss-check.yml` still uses the deprecated `::set-output` syntax, so the Netlify rebuild
  step may silently never fire. Worth verifying before trusting the podcast auto-sync.
- The codebase runs on Svelte 5 but is written in legacy `export let` / `$:` syntax, not runes.
