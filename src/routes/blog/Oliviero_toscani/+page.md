During the pandemic, I had the ritual to watch every day a live session on Instaram made by Oliviero Toscani. Oliviero, probably bored as everybody else, had the routine to start a live session on instagram, where he talked about photography but also, of course, about the current pandemic.

I always loved his work, and I found really funny his strong and bold personality. Of course, when a person has only bold opinions, it is really hard to always agree with all of them. In fact, I do not agree with a lot of bold opinions Olivero has. But this do not touch my admiration for the artist.

When as a kid I discovered my passion for photography, he was one of the first artist I studied and one of the first way of communicate with images I encountered in my photographer path, and I loved it from the first moment.

Love him or hate him. And I love his creative work <Sidenote text="He would probably hit my head with a camera, because of the 'improper' use of the word creativity." />.

## The contest
One day, he had an idea: Why don't we make a photo contest all toghether? In some seconds he made the idea concrete, and asked to all the people watching the live <Sidenote text="We were few thousends people" /> to send a self protrait that represent the meaning of quarantine for us.

What does it mean quarantine for you? How are you experiencing that? Take a self protrait to explain it.

After that, he wanted to make a selection of the best protrait to send to Repubblica, a national newspaper, to post on their website the selection every week.

What a fantastic idea!

I leaved my passion for photography aside, due to the busy life <Sidenote text="Kids are a black hole for time" />. This was the opportunity to be creative with a camera once again.

## The pictures
I immediately started to think and explore ideas. What does the quarantine means for me?

The restrictions started to hit me, also if I am somebody that love to stay at home. My sensation was a kind of ager, ora need to escape.

I decided to play with exposure times and, using the flash, I first blocked my face in a expressionless face, to represent the boredom and the resignation visible on the outside. Than I leaved the shutter opened for in a series of 4 shots, without flash. During the few seconds of the exposure, I moved my head in a direction, tryng to scream, to represent my inner need to excape.

This is the result:

I was kind of satisfied, but I know that it wasn't in the chords of Oliviero. He always said "Stop trying to be creative! Just express yourself in the easy way. The more you try to impress other that you are a creative person, the worst art you produce."

And I tought that this picture could be categorized from him as one of those pictures of somebody that tries to be creative. And somehow he is also right <Sidenote text="A reason why I love him: really hard sentence that hit you in the face, but if you put your ego apart... you know it's true." />.

Then I wanted to let my wife participate, but she wasn't so excited from the idea as I was, so she said "You can make my protrait".

I stated immediately to think something creative, but then I just tried to do what Oliviero said. Stop tring to find the most "creative" and amazing idea. Just do the job. Represent the quarantine with a picture of a person.

One day, I had my camera on, and my wife was on the sofa, bored.

Boredom was defenitely part of the quarantine. Then, she started to yawn.

Well, without thinking I just pointed my camera and I shooted.

This was the amazing result:

Satisfied with the pictures, I sent everything to Oliviero.
<!-- TODO: explain that you had some doubt on which picture to send, as you made more then one. but somehow you know that this picture was strong -->

## A dream came true
Days passed, as thousend of people was sending pictures like i did, and he was overwelmed from the response of this contest. The amount of pictures was huge and he, along with his collaborators, was doing the selection work.

This means that was really hard to track my picture status. Were both accepted? Or rejected? When will be visible on Repubblica?

At the beginning I checked the website of rebubblica every day, then I tried to never miss a live, as he showed his progress to some guests and showed some pictures, that he found the best pictures of the selection he made.

Was actually quite exsausting, because every day I hoped to see one of my pictures, but every time I was disappointed, thinking that maybe my pictures were really rejected.

Then, one day, I was already in the resignation phase, I was watching another live session fo Oliviero. Bored and hopless.

There was a guest that day, Gad Lerner, an amazing italian journalist that I admire.

Oliviero said "Hey Gad! I'll show you some amazing pictures I received! It's amazing how many incredible pictures I got! Look at this one, and this one ..." And he was pointing his smartphone's camera to the selected pictures.

And then I saw it.

Oliviero selected the portrait of my wife as an "amazing work", along with other amazing pictures.

As a person with a passion for photography, who worked a lot in the photography industry, who admire the work of Oliviero Toscani, tring somehow to communicate with images as he does, this was an overwhelming moment.

It was, finally, the moment where my creative work was aknowledged and appriciated. And not from somebody, but from Oliviero Toscani!

That moment meant that I was right. That my taste in the visual art is right. That if I find a picture or an idea cool, and somebody else do not, I have to do what I think is right. And this was the confirmation that I was right.

I have then never tried to look again every day on the repubblica website, and I started to miss some live session of Oliviero, slowly stopping to watch.

I didn't care if my portrait was also selected or not. And I don't know if this picture or both were posted on the repubblica homepage. Everything wasn't important anymore. I already won the contest.

What an amazing experience. Thank you for reading this little personal story, and thank you Oliviero!
