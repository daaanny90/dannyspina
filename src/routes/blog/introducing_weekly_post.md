Browsing the Blog of [Emanuele Bartolesi](https://www.emanuelebartolesi.com/) I was flashed by his series ‚ÄúWeekly‚Äù. 

He makes a Review of his week posting just a concise summary of each day of the week with a mood emoji at the end, to express the overall feeling of that day.

And‚Ä¶ I will shamelessly copy this format üòÉ Sorry Emanuele, but it fits perfectly with my commitment to write more in my blog!

All weekly post titles will have this format: `Weekly<week_number><YY>`. Like, the next and the first one, will have the title Weekly0223.

If you don‚Äôt know [Emanuele Bartolesi](https://www.emanuelebartolesi.com/), is then a good chance to visit his blog and know more about him.
