"Free Software, Free Society" by Sam Williams is a must-have for anyone interested in the ethical side of software development and code. This book provides an in-depth look at the history, philosophy, and culture of the free software movement and its impact on society as a whole.

The writing style is engaging, but at times can be a bit heavy and difficult to follow. However, for those who are dedicated to the topic, the effort is well worth it. The book is filled with insightful observations and thought-provoking ideas that will challenge your assumptions and deepen your understanding of the free software movement.

Overall, I found this book to be very fascinating, even if a bit dense at times. If you're passionate about the ethical implications of software development, this book belongs in your library. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to expand their knowledge on the topic.
