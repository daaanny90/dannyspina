**Hello!**

This is the first post on my new website. My old personal website was a **WordPress site** hosted on a **normal server** with a hosting service.

Everything is fine with it, the only thing is that the last post was **more than 2 years old**. And in those two years, a lot has happened, **I have changed** as a person and as a developer.

That WordPress website wasn't anymore a digital representation of who I am.
The design was all delegated to a free theme and the technical part was all delegated to WordPress and the hosting service.

This new website is different. **I get rid of WordPress** (nothing against it, it is just not the tool I want to use) and **I get rid also of the hosting service**. Kind of.

The website is made with **Svelte** and hosted on **Netlify**, directly connected to the GitHub repo where the source code is. Every time I push a commit into master then will be live deployed.

This is the way **I get rid of a CMS** at all: I write the posts in Markdown, and I commit them to the repo.

The static website is incredibly fast, I don't have to update anything, and have no plugins that bloat my code. Just what I need, no CMS, no server, nothing.

**This is called Jamstack.**

If you want to check the code, [this is the GitHub repo.](https://github.com/daaanny90/dannyspina)

I am really satisfied with the new stack I'm using.
About the design... well, I am still experimenting with it, it will probably change with time.

As the subtitle on the homepage says, **I call myself a "digital craftsman"**, an artisan that works with code instead of wood or marble. And I want that the design of my website represents this idea.

I will explain this concept more in detail in the next posts.

**Bye!**
