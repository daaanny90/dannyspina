I'm thrilled to share that the [JSON.resume](https://github.com/daaanny90/JSON.resume) project has reached an important milestoneâ€”the proof of concept (POC) is now complete and ready for testing! I have successfully utilized JSON.resume to generate my own CV, which you can explore at [cv.dannyspina.com](https://cv.dannyspina.com). While there is still work to be done to refine and polish the project, the journey thus far has been both enjoyable and educational, particularly in the realm of PDF generation.

## Simplifying CV Generation

The motivation behind JSON.resume was to simplify the process of managing and updating curriculum vitae. The frustrations of formatting and editing text in traditional editors inspired me to create a solution that would allow us to focus on our accomplishments and experiences, rather than getting caught up in design and formatting issues.

I discovered the importance of visually appealing CVs that convey professionalism and capture attention. Through extensive exploration and experimentation, I gained valuable insights into layout, typography, and the art of presenting information effectively in a digital format.
